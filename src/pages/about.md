i like coding/programming/whatever you want to call it. not because i enjoy sitting behind a computer and pressing keys on a little keyboard for 8hrs a day but because it's like solving a lot of different mini puzzles while also building something (sometimes) useful. i have studied some coding in school, i am doing coding on my job, i have started many (failed) mini businesses by coding and i currently also have a succesful business that i can only do because of coding.

so basically i think the combination of solving little puzzles + building something makes for a pretty addicting combination which just happens to stimulate me enough to make me want to do it quite a lot

i also like other normal human being things that together kind of form my identity

- music, creating it when i have inspiration aswell as going to concerts (100+ and counting hehe)
- people & hanging out
- other cultures & travel, people are interesting
- doing things people in their 20s like to do
- creating a lot of things. it comes in waves but in general i would say i do quite a lot. basically i cannot really just sit there and game all day, i would feel guilty
- thinking about myself and my life and ways to improve it (not in the grindset work 24/7 way but in the nice actually being happy way) (possibly read more about that on this blog)
- many other things which i have yet to find out or i cannot think of right now

but i guess i put coding first because most people that have blogs will state their profession since their blogs usually serve as a way for them to further their career. that is not the purpose of this blog though, so the actual reason i put coding first is because wether i want to admit it or not it is a pretty big part of my life right now and most of my personal output consists of coding projects at the as of writing this on 9 jul 2023
