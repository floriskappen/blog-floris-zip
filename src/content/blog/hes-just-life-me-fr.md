description: After learning the basics of web dev, I started working on my first big project. It's cool enough to share.

Recently, I was watching a [video parasocial relationships](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2Iy-WKeZrU), particularly prevalent in East Asia. The concept pivots on our inherent tendency to form connections with individuals we regularly encounter—a leftover trait from our caveman era when bonding with tribe members was crucial for survival. Now, in the age of ubiquitous internet connectivity, we can follow virtually anyone online, providing us with an overwhelming number of potential connections with people that will never even know we exist.

This new paradigm has led to a significant shift in the way we form our world view. A deluge of discourse has already existed for years around how television, the internet, and social media can distort our perception of reality. To bring this concept closer to home, let's use YouTube consumption as an example. Like many, I often find myself invested in various YouTubers. I respect some, look up to others, and hold opinions about many. Some serve as sources of inspiration. However, not everyone can carve a niche for themselves on YouTube.

### The two criteria

Becoming a successful YouTuber requires meeting two significant criteria. These criteria are obviously simplifying reality but they will hopefully explain my point.

Firstly, you need to harbor a deep passion for creating content, specifically video content. This condition already excludes a vast majority of the global population. Few people possess the inclination to generate and then also publicize their creations. Even fewer prefer videos as their medium of expression. Therefore, one could argue that a certain type of individual is drawn to the realm of YouTube. Despite the diverse backgrounds of YouTubers and their different niches, they all share an enthusiasm for video creation and putting themselves out there. This shared trait, though just a fragment of their personalities, forms a unifying thread.

Secondly, your content needs to achieve a level of success that ensures it appears on the homepage of viewers. The recipe for this success remains elusive despite being widely discussed by people trying to "hack the algorithm". It undoubtedly includes a hefty dose of luck, but also hinges on a certain "magic". This magic involves nebulous factors such as cultural relevance and attractiveness—not necessarily physical appeal, but an allure that engages a subset of viewers who encounter the content.

Thus, of the relatively few individuals who possess the inclination for content creation (the first criterion), only a small fraction will manage to pass the second filter of achieving significant success.

### What this leads to

The dual criterion concept can be applied to all forms of media or platforms where a large audience consumes content from a restricted group of creators. We naturally gravitate towards observing others—it provides a sense of safety, gives the impression that they have a handle on things, and saves us from worrying. We revel in following others' narratives because we can learn from their decisions without having to make those choices ourselves.

Recognizing this, particularly for those deeply immersed in the digital world aka people that are chronically online, can significantly alter our perception of people and the assumptions we form. It is very obvious to everyone that there are way more people out there than the ones we see on our screens. But I feel like not enough emphasis is being put on the fact that there are way more **types** of people than the ones we see on our screens. By having passed the first criterion, the person you are looking at falls into the same group everyone on our screens does: a small subset of people that are inclined to create in a specific way. This group does not represent the wider world around us.

### Denial

I feel like this might be hard to realize for some because we try to relate so much to the people in media. So we want to assume that they are normal.

Because of this I would be hesitant to trust someone who is chronically online to make accurate judgements about people they meet in real life. But depending on who you are this might not matter in this age. For me however, this is a nice reminder which tells me that I should focus on keeping a balance by not only connecting to people I see on my screen but also with people in real life.
