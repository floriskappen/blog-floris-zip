# Learning projects

In the summer vacation of 2019 I started learning Web Development. I started following several Udemy courses. Since then I've created a few git repositories containing some of the projects made when following those courses or tutorials.

For web development, this was really the perfect way for me to learn. I am motivated by cool projects, so this practical approach is very nice. For more theoretical subjects like machine learning I wouldn't recommend Udemy courses though. There are also a lot of courses out there that use buzzwords to draw you in while the actual content is lacking depth.

## Table of contents

## NodeJS learning projects

In Sept 2019 I followed a NodeJS course where I worked on a series of small projects to learn about design patterns and best practices.

### Weather API interaction

In the first project of this series, I worked on a small script that interacted with weather & geocoding API's. I think it's very nice to use existing API's for your learning projects as it can add a lot of value without you having to make everything on your own.

In this case the app consisted of a page where you can enter an address, which it converts to a latitude and longitude, which it then sends to another API to give the weather forecast for that region.

I was also taught how to deploy these apps to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) which made it possible to share with others.

### Task manager API

In this project I created my own API. The user flow was as follows:

1. You register an account
2. You log in
3. You upload an avatar (optional)
4. Create a new task
5. Get all tasks
6. Update the status of a task

There were some other features but this was basically it.

I remember user validation and uploading files to be the hardest things. Now that I look back, I would never store avatars as a Base64 string in my database anymore, but I guess that was the easiest option for this tutorial.

### Chatbox App

For the last project of the series I created a chatbox app. It sounds really cool, and it was at the time, but in reality it is really simple. The front-end was given to me by the tutor, the project was just building the API again, as this is was NodeJS course.

You would type in the name of a room to join, and type in a username. Once you're in a room, everyone would see that a new user has joined. And then it's the standard behaviour for a chat app.

### Conclusion

I love NodeJS, because even though I started as a front-end developer with javascript, it was very easy to learn back-end because it's the same programming language.

## The "Complete Web Developer Course"

I followed this very general but good web development course. This was actually my first real intro to webdev. It was extremely long, but I was so excited that I blased through it, skipping a few parts I already understood. For example, I could skip the HTML & CSS parts. But I really started learning more about Javascript here, which was awesome.

It was super hard at first but eventually it just clicked, and it went pretty smoothly from there.

I also learned about databases, what an API was and even the basics of Python. But the Javascript knowledge was the real highlight.

## Typescript

So at the time of writing this (2021) I don't actually use Typescript that much. I think it was nice to learn it, and I do still remember the core concepts, but even though it's a popular option I haven't really felt the need for it yet. I guess it does make more sense to use it in bigger projects, while the projects I was working on at the time were just small personal ones.

## React

Front-end development started with [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) for me. And I love that framework, I'm very glad that that's the framework I've learnt first. But at the time, the most popular front-end framework/library was [React](https://reactjs.org/) by far, so I thought I should learn it just in case. For this I created an ecommerce website using [Google's Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) as my backend. Pretty cool project, from which I learned a lot of things that translated over into [Vue](https://vuejs.org/)!

A cool project I made in React was this [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) app. You can see it in action here:

## Conclusion

I followed more web development courses, but these were the highlights for me. After learning a bunch I decided to create some cool projects for my portfolio, which you can check out on this site. I also eventually applied for a part-time job at [Gravity](https://gravity.nl/) where I learned a lot aswell and worked on tons of projects to boost my skills to the next level. That's also where I learned a lot of soft skills, which are very important too. You can't learn those by grinding out Udemy courses!
